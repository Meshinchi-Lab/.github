Welcome to the Meshinchi Lab at Fred Hutch. 

Led by Soheil Meshinchi, M.D., Ph.D., our research laboratory is studying genomic expression of acute myeloid leukemia-restricted targets on the cell surface that are ideal for immunotherapeutic targeting with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapies, as well as identifying and validating target genes for further immunotherapy development.
