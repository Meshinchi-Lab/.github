Welcome to the Meshinchi Lab at Fred Hutch. 

Led by [Soheil Meshinchi, M.D., Ph.D.,](https://research.fredhutch.org/meshinchi/en.html) our research laboratory is studying genomic expression of acute myeloid leukemia-restricted targets on the cell surface that are ideal for immunotherapeutic targeting with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapies, as well as identifying and validating target genes for further immunotherapy development.

Currently, working in collaboration with [Franco Locatelli, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/area-di-ricerca---oncoematologia-94851/) and [Concetta Quintarelli, M.D., Ph.D.](https://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/terapia-genica-dei-tumori-95043/) at the [Bambino Ges√π Children's Hospital IRCCS](https://www.ospedalebambinogesu.it/ricerca/) in Rome, Italy, we are investigating the potential of CAR T-cell therapy in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) patients.
